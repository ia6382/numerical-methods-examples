# Numerical Methods Examples

# About
Several numerical analysis algorithms implemented in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/).
Homework for the Numerical Mathematics course at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science. The course covered several important algorithms and approaches for numerically solving problems in the following topics: systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, systems of nonlinear equations, interpolation and aproximation, integration, derivation, systems of differential equations.

# Files
Each folder contains the source code of the algorithm, short automatic tests and an extensive documentation in the Slovenian language. To briefly summerize, it includes the following content:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

# Instructions
start julia REPL (in Visual Studio Code IDE with Julia extenstion the shortcut is alt+j)
include("sourceFile.jl") to use functions of the source file
include("test.jl") to run the automatic tests
